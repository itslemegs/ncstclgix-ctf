    <p>It looks like you're not connected to the Internet. Try these things to get connected: </p>
    
      <ul><li>
          <p>Verify that your network cable is plugged in.</p>
        </li><li>
          <p>Make sure you're not in airplane mode. Go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Network &amp; Internet</b> &gt; <b>Airplane mode</b> and make sure it's turned off. </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>Go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Network &amp; Internet</b> &gt; <b>Wi-Fi</b>, and make sure Wi-Fi is turned on. If a network you expect to see appears in the list, select the network, and then select <b>Connect</b>. </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>Let Windows try to help you fix the problem. In the Search box, type <b>Network troubleshooter</b>, and then select <b>Identify and repair network problems</b>. (Itâ€™ll say <b>Control panel</b> under the setting.) </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>Connect to a cellular network on your PC if you can. Go to <b>Settings</b> &gt; <b>Network &amp; Internet</b>, and see if <b>Cellular</b> appears in the list of settings. </p>
        </li><li>
          <p>If you're at home and expect to see your Wi-Fi network but don't, restart your Wi-Fi router. This should be a last resort.</p>
        </li></ul>
